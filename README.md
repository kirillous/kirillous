## I'm Kirill

👋 Hi, I am Kirill Markin! I am a Statistics student at Simon Fraser University. My focus is on machine learning and applied data science. Based in Vancouver, BC.

## About me

I’m a passionate Statistics student with a strong interest in machine learning, data science, inference, and building data-driven solutions. I enjoy turning complex datasets into meaningful insights, crafting analytical tools, and exploring modern approaches in predictive modeling. Through my projects, I aim to combine rigorous statistical thinking with practical implementation to solve real-world problems and continuously grow as a problem-solver.

## Technical Skills 🛠️

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, R, HTML/CSS
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels, scipy, xgboost, scikit-learn
- **Statistical tools:** EDA, Hypothesis testing & CIs,  experiment design, time series
- **Machine Learning:** Bias-variance tradeoff, model evaluation & cross-validation, linear & logistic regression, tree based modeling, feature engineering, PCA

## Key Projects 📚

- **[Yandex Music Algorithm Analysis](https://github.com/kirillous/YAMBDA-algorithm-analysis):** Evaluation of YandexMusic’s recommendation system using propensity scores to estimate short-term effects on user experience from 50M events listening data.
- **[Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/kirillous/SalesAnalysis):** End-to-end analysis of retail sales data combining pricing analysis, market basket methods, ABC classification, and machine learning to optimize inventory decisions and improve demand forecasting.
- **[Plant Data Analysis](https://github.com/kirillous/statistical-analysis):** Exploratory and multivariate analysis of plant measurement data, revealing linear dependencies and distinct species clusters through PCA and k-means clustering.

## Professional Goals 🚀
- **Long-Term Vision:** Apply rigorous statistical reasoning and modern ML techniques to solve complex, real-world problems. I aim to continuously grow at the intersection of theory and practice.
- **Problem-Solving Philosophy:** I value well-evaluated solutions that combine strong theoretical foundations with results that are meaningful and actionable in the context of the problem.
- **Positive Impact:** My goal is to use data and statistical thinking to support better decision-making and create measurable value. My goal is to translate analysis into insights that have a clear, practical impact on products, users, or organizations.
